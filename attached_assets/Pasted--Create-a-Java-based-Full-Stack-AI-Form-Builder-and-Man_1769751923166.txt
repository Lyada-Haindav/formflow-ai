"Create a Java-based Full-Stack AI Form Builder and Management system (Spring Boot + React) that allows users to generate, build, and deploy multi-step forms with AI assistance."

1. Core Features & User Flows:

AI Form Generation: Users can describe a form via a prompt. The backend (Spring Boot) integrates with an AI service (OpenAI/Gemini) to return a structured JSON configuration for a multi-step form.
Dynamic Form Builder: A drag-and-drop interface (using dnd-kit or similar) to manually add, edit, and reorder steps and fields.
Multi-Step Navigation: Forms are split into logical steps. The UI handles "Next/Previous" transitions with validation.
Template Library: Users can browse pre-configured templates and clone them to create new forms.
Submissions & Analytics: A public preview page for users to submit data. A dashboard to view, filter, and export submission data (CSV/Excel).
AI Field Suggestions: While editing, users can request AI suggestions for relevant fields based on the current form's context.
Voice-Enabled Input: Support for filling out form fields via voice (Web Speech API).
2. Backend Architecture (Java/Spring Boot):

Framework: Spring Boot 3.x
Data Access: Spring Data JPA with PostgreSQL.
Security: Spring Security with JWT for stateless authentication.
Integrations:
OpenAI/Gemini Java SDK for form generation and field suggestions.
Hibernate for entity mapping and automated schema management.
API Design: RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations on Forms, Steps, Fields, and Submissions.
3. Database Schema (Entities):

User: id (UUID), email, passwordHash, createdAt.
Form: id (UUID), userId (FK), title, description, isPublished (Boolean), templateId (FK, optional), createdAt, updatedAt.
Step: id (UUID), formId (FK), title, description, orderIndex (Integer).
Field: id (UUID), stepId (FK), type (e.g., text, number, select, radio, date), label, placeholder, defaultValue, required (Boolean), orderIndex (Integer), options (JSONB for select/radio options), validationRules (JSONB), conditionalLogic (JSONB).
Submission: id (UUID), formId (FK), data (JSONB payload of responses), submittedAt.
Template: id (UUID), name, description, icon, category, config (JSONB full structure).
4. Frontend Stack:

Framework: React (TypeScript) with Vite.
UI Components: Shadcn/UI, Tailwind CSS, Lucide icons.
Form Management: React Hook Form + Zod for client-side validation.
Data Fetching: TanStack Query (React Query) for efficient API state management.
5. Technical Requirements:

JSONB Handling: Map JSONB columns in Postgres to Map<String, Object> or dedicated POJOs in Java.
Recursive Deletion: Configure JPA CascadeType.ALL and orphanRemoval=true so deleting a form cleans up all steps, fields, and submissions.
Cloning Logic: Implement a "Clone Template" service that deep-copies a template's structure into a new user-owned form.
